Robot Framework Dos and Dont's
==============================

A slide set that demonstrates general guidelines how to create good
`Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`__ test cases. Shows both
good practices and antipatterns.

I have used this presentation once and it worked well, but there are
some more examples I plan to add later. Eventually plan to put the
presentation online somewhere too.

Examples shown in the slides are in `<examples>`__ directory. Included
`<examples/genpng.py>`__ script can be used to convert them to png
format.
